# Traffic-Prediction-
A real-time traffic prediction system using TomTom API. Users input source, destination, and time to get live traffic level (Low/Medium/High), estimated travel time, and route visualization on an interactive map. Built using Python, TomTom API, and Folium.
## What It Does

- Takes user input:
  - Source location
  - Destination location
  - Time
- Fetches real-time travel data using the TomTom Routing API
- Predicts traffic level:
  - Low (≤ 15 minutes)
  - Medium (≤ 30 minutes)
  - High (> 30 minutes)
- Displays:
  - Estimated travel time and distance
  - Traffic level classification
  - Map with the suggested route

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- TomTom Geocoding and Routing APIs
- Folium for route visualization
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook for running the code
